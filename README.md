Stuff to be done

Database has been updated. Give it a whirl.

1) Everyone does the view page of whatever they worked on for part 1
   Its just tabluar data. Don't worry about adding ASC/DESC ordering
   for the  columns. Fuck that noise in its entirety. 
   
2) Need someone(s) to work on page layout for:
   - Enter Report
   - View Report
   They don't need to be functional, just look like the mockup.
